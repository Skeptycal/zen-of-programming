# My Tech Story


  I thought we would learn how to use Microsoft Word and Excel -- I genuinely had no idea what code was. My high school definitely did not have any coding classes, they barely had functioning computers! I didn't play video games or engage in activities that traditionally lead to kids learning how to code either. So coding was brand new to me when I took that Python class in college.

As soon as I walked into the classroom, they had us type Python code into Idle, a text editor that comes with the Python language. They had printed the code and just had us type it in and run it -- I was immediately hooked. Over the course of that class, I built a Tic Tac Toe script with a GUI to input pieces and a Flappy Bird clone. It honestly came pretty easy to me, and I had a ton of fun. I quickly decided to minor in computer science, and I just wanted to write more code.

The next semester, I enrolled in a Data Structures and Algorithms course which was next in the computer science sequence. The class was taught in C++, which, unbeknown to me was supposed to be learned over the summer before the class. It quickly became obvious that the professors were trying to use the class to filter out students -- around 50% of the enrollees on day one made it through the semester. We even changed classrooms from a lecture hall to a break out room. My pride was the only thing keeping me in the class. I felt completely lost in pretty much every lesson. I spent many all-nighters working on projects and studying for the exams.

One problem in particular really got me -- we were supposed to build a program in C++ that would solve any Sudoku problem. Again, I spent countless hours on the assignment trying to get the code working. By the time the project was due, my solution worked for some of the test cases but not all of them. I ended up getting a C+ on my assignment -- one of my worst grades in all of college.

After that semester, I abandoned my idea of minoring in computer science, completely quit coding, and stuck to what I thought I was good at -- writing and politics.

Of course, funny things happen in life and I obviously started coding again, but it took me a long time to feel like I was a competent programmer.

All that being said, a few years later into my programming journey, I decided to retry implementing the Sudoku solving algorithm to prove it to myself that I could implement it now. The code isn't perfect, but it will solve pretty much any Sudoku puzzle. Let's walk through the algorithm and then the implementation.





On top of that, I wasn't a member of nerd culture at all growing up. For most of high school, my goal was to work in fashion. Once I got my first volunteer campaign job during the 2015 New Hampshire Primary, that turned into my career goal -- I wanted to be a journalist on the ground for political campaigns. I still have never seen Star Wars or The Lord of The Rings, I didn't play video games growing up other than online paperdolls, and I still don't at all understand Pokemon.

That Freshman year computer science class was my first exposure to code whatsoever -- I thought computer science classes were going to teach us about Excel and how to properly format Word documents.

I remember the roller coaster cycles of building my first scripts. I built
