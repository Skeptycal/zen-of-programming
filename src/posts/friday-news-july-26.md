This week was pretty crazy, I'm wrapping up a summer in Hartford Connecticut and I am gearing up for a couple weeks of much needed vacation! I'm still having a lot of fun writing here as much as I can; my [speaking post](https://dev.to/aspittel/public-speaking-as-a-developer-2ihj) took a lot more time than a lot of posts. That being said, I wrote two posts this week instead of a new one each day, but those posts were pretty in depth so I spent a similar amount of time writing!

I have another exciting project launching this week, I will be co-hosting a Twitter chat on art, design, and code with [Dominic Duffin](https://twitter.com/DominicDuffin1). The first one will be a "Hello, world" chat this Sunday at 1 PM EST. Follow [the account](https://twitter.com/ArtTechChat) or the #ArtTechChat to join in!

## Shout Outs

* [Python has brought computer programming to a vast new audience](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/07/21/python-has-brought-computer-programming-to-a-vast-new-audience) - Python was my first programming language, and it is still my favorite to write code in. I have been following the news of Guido van Rossum's abdication of the "Benevolent Dictator for Life" position, and I think this post is a really good summary of the situation and Python as a whole. I really love programming languages that try to be accessible and easier to learn, like Python and Ruby.
* [Overcoming My Fear of Confrontation](http://www.mackenziehoran.com/2018/07/18/overcoming-my-fear-of-confrontation/) - This post felt too real to me! I am very, very conflict avoidant, and I think getting better at dealing with confrontation would be really helpful from both a personal and career perspective.
* [The Little Details of UI Design](https://speakerdeck.com/sschoger/the-little-details-of-ui-design) - This presentation by Steve Schoger is really informative. It goes through a complete restyling of the LinkedIn website, and it gives the justification for each tweak. I really like the visual nature of it, and I learned a lot of design tips from the deck!
* [The importance of donuts](https://larahogan.me/donuts/) - I really like this webpage that Lara Hogan built. She eats (and photographs) donuts after each big career win, and then she posts the pictures online. I am a big believer in tracking accomplishments -- I use a Google Keep document to keep track of my wins, but I really love how fun the donut method is!
* [I Want to Be Rich and I'm Not Sorry](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/opinion/sunday/women-want-to-be-rich.html) - I really like this article by Jessica Knoll about the fine line that women walk when they want to be successful.
* [Wheel](https://hihayk.github.io/wheel/) - I really like this color palette generator. It's really pretty, and a lot simpler than some other ones!
* [Does it mutate](https://doesitmutate.xyz/) - Super helpful guide to whether or not JavaScript methods mutate the data structure they are called on.
* [The Moth Podcast](https://play.google.com/music/m/Ik7uauytdyxmq6qzjsaho4e5x2e?t=The_Moth) - I am obsessed with this podcast where people tell their stories. So many are moving, funny, and inspirational.
* [#EthicalCS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ethicalcs&src=typd) - I really enjoyed the Ethical CS education chat this week. People's responses were really cool and encouraging. It also talked about the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) code of ethics, which I found really cool!

## My Posts

* [Extreme Makeover: Code Edition](https://zen-of-programming.com/cleaner-code) - My top 7 tips for cleaning up your code base!
* [Public Speaking as a Developer](https://zen-of-programming.com/speaking-as-a-developer/) - The follow up post to my [Blogging as a Developer](https://dev.to/aspittel/blogging-as-a-developer--5h0m) post goes through all my tips for conference speaking -- from the call for papers process up through the day of the talk!

## Social Media

* My [Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/aspit) was approved this week -- I'm definitely looking for must follows on there so please give me suggestions!
* I've been trying [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ali_writes_code/) out a little bit recently. I'm not 100% sure if I'm going to stick with it, but here's  are some of my posts from this week!
