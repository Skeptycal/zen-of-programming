Happy Friday! I've had this week off (and next week!), so I'm writing this from New York City where I'm vacationing. It's been nice to not be working all the time, and it will be even more awesome to move back to DC next week. 

I do, however, want to thank all of the awesome people who were really encouraging to me this week! I had my first negative blogging experience this week -- my tips for new developers got posted on Reddit, and, though it was really awesome to see my post perform well, some of the comments were really nasty. That being said, I've also had a really positive and encouraging response on Twitter and on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) which made me feel a lot better!

## Shout Outs

* [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) - speaking of dev.to, they [open sourced](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to) this week! I know its been a lot of work and time coming, so I'm super happy for them, especially because the response has been so awesome!
* [Growing Up Jobs](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/lisa-brennan-jobs-small-fry-steve-jobs-daughter) - I thought this excerpt from Lisa Brennan-Jobs' story was fascinating and appalling. I'm definitely adding the full book to my reading list.
* [The Cost of JavaScript in 2018](https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4) - I thought this look into how much JavaScript weighs down sites and how much that can affect user experience was really interesting. Definitely something to keep in mind.
* [Vue.js, Evan You, and the intersection between art, design, and technology](https://blog.tidelift.com/vuejs-evan-you-javascript-framework) - I love Vue.js, and I found this profile of its writer, Evan You, very interesting -- I didn't know that his background is in art and design!
* [What HBR Gets Wrong About Algorithms and Bias](http://www.fast.ai/2018/08/07/hbr-bias-algorithms/) - I totally agree with this article about how algorithms still depend on humans and they aren't totally neutral. 
* [Useful Pens for Everyday Front End Development](https://codepen.io/collection/nMgKxJ/) - a must bookmark list of Codepens from Sarah Drasner!
* [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/) - a very visually appealing and helpful list of things to keep in mind when creating interfaces.

## My Posts

I wrote two posts this week; however, I haven't published one. I may end up sending it out as a bonus this week. I don't love it as a stand alone article, but it answers my (now) most frequent question about my favorite coding resources. It was originally a part of my list of tips for new developers, but I thought it didn't flow very well and made that post too long!

So, my one new post from this week was [25 Tips for New Developers: Advice from a (Mostly) Self-Taught Software Engineer](https://zen-of-programming.com/start-programming).

I also have two older posts that were featured on FreeCodeCamp with some edits and new titles üòÇ:

* [How to build a kickbutt portfolio](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-build-a-kickbutt-portfolio-57b26a0b825d)

* [How I came back to an old problem and finally wrote a Sudoku-solving algorithm](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/coming-back-to-old-problems-how-i-finally-wrote-a-sudoku-solving-algorithm-3b371e6c63bd)

## Social Media

* I've been posting every day on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ali_writes_code/), one project I'm excited about is my ["Bumper Sticker Story"](https://www.instagram.com/p/BmLsF9mhCg0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) where I'm posting one of my laptop bumper stickers and the story behind it each day! I also have an Instagram moment with all of these if you want to catch up!
* My favorite #CodingPuzzle this week on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASpittel) was [Form The Largest](https://twitter.com/ASpittel/status/1027313597960081409).

## Next Week

I'm still on vacation (and moving) next week, but I still plan on posting! I really want to write about the intersection of art and code and what that means to me, and I also plan on publishing my list of favorite learn-to-code resources!
