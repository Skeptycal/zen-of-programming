Hi friends!

Hope you had an awesome week. This is going to be the last week that I write my newsletter in this format -- it's getting a makeover next week, so stay tuned for that ðŸŽ‰!

# My Stuff

* [Intro to Generative Art](https://dev.to/aspittel/intro-to-generative-art-2hi7) - I wrote a blog post to introduce the fundamentals of generative art with my friend [James](https://twitter.com/1800thehive), we also gave a [talk](https://www.alispit.tel/generative-art-talk/) on it this week for a local meetup which was a lot of fun!
* [FreeCodeCamp Podcast](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quincylarson/ali-spittel-creator-of-zen-of-programming--krk00lk24) - I did my first ever podcast! I told my story and some of my advice for new coders. I was so nervous, but it was really fun to do!

# Creative Stuff

* [ColorBox](https://www.colorbox.io/) - This may be the most in-depth color picker I've ever seen. You can adjust a few toggles and get a really awesome color palette for your site or artwork. You can even export that palette to JSON when you're done!
* [Generative Art Speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk) - I really enjoyed this talk by Tim Holman. He gave a great introduction to what generative art is and how to start building it.
* [A New Look at CSS Shapes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/09/css-shapes/) - CSS is the coolest, and these CSS shapes make it even cooler. 
* [Having fun with link hover effects](https://css-tricks.com/having-fun-with-link-hover-effects/) - I love this effect on  [The Outline's site](https://theoutline.com/), I was really excited to read this post about how to re-create them!

# Coding Resources

* [If you don't hire juniors, you don't deserve seniors - Isaac Lyman](https://dev.to/isaacandsuch/if-you-dont-hire-juniors-you-dont-deserve-seniors-48kb) - I really agree with this post. I also really enjoyed the #DevDiscuss Twitter chat that was inspired by it -- being a good mentor and supporting newer developers is so important, and we as an industry could do better!
* [Small Tweaks That Can Make a Huge Impact on Your Websiteâ€™s Accessibility](https://css-tricks.com/small-tweaks-can-make-huge-impact-websites-accessibility/) - Awesome tips for adding more accessibility to your site -- accessibility is so important, and it often isn't super hard to make your site more accessible.

## Life

* It's been a tough week given the political climate. I've been off of social media a little bit more than usual, and I'm definitely not the peppiest I've ever been. It definitely doesn't make this easier, but [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/spenceralthouse/infomercial-fails-el-oh-el) are some infomercial fails that may make you smile a little. 

Happy Friday!
Ali
