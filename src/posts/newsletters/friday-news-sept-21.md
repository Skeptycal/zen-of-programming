Hi friends!

# My Stuff

* This week, I launched [Learn Code from Us](https://learncodefrom.us/), a platform for highlighting coding content creators from underrepresented backgrounds in tech. [Here's](https://dev.to/aspittel/introducing-learn-code-from-us-oe1) a blog post explaining the full project. I would super appreciate any social media sharing. Also, if you are a content creator from an underrepresented group in tech,  [here](https://airtable.com/shrYbUMMlR1iVpA1l) is a form you can fill out to apply to be included!
* I did a talk last weekend on how to start a developer blog for Women Who Code DC! [These](https://zen-of-programming.com/blogging-links) are all the links for the slides, worksheets, and additional resources that I gave to attendees!
* I'm doing a talk on [Generative Art](https://nvite.com/CodePenDC/q7qxn8) with my friend James this Tuesday. It should be really fun!

# Creative Stuff

* [School for Poetic Computation](https://medium.com/sfpc/fall-2018-week-1-694bcb0703b1) - They are a school that is "organized around exploring the creative and expressive nature of computational approaches to art and design." They do so many cool things, and I really enjoy perusing their curriculum and posts about what they are doing!

# Coding Resources

* [10 practices for readable code](https://dev.to/gonedark/10-practices-for-readable-code-143a) - these are great tips to follow for cleaning up your code.
* [What is an Indie Hacker?](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1EzCysvT6Ec31WiU6hZ9NQ) - I really enjoyed this episode of the CodeNewbie podcast with Courtland Allen, it made me really interested in the idea of trying to do my own thing in a few years!

# Blogging

* [Carly's tips for blogging](https://www.carlytheprepster.com/2018/02/blogging-tips-part-2.html) -  I love this lifestyle blog, and her tips for blogging are great!

# Life

* 25 before 25 - I made a list of 25 things that I want to do before I turn 25 next year. I am only going to share each one when it's complete though!
* Van Life - I discovered the van life trend on social media, which is a bunch of people who live out of renovated vans and travel the country! I've been super fascinated by it all week.

Happy Friday!
Ali
