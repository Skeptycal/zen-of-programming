Hi friends!

Sorry I'm later than usual this week, I've had a lot going on!

# My Stuff

* I'm talking at a couple things coming up if you're in the DC area! I'm doing a [Blogging Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/events/253906246/) for Women Who Code tomorrow, and then I'm doing a talk on [Generative Art](https://nvite.com/CodePenDC/q7qxn8) with my friend James ain a few weeks! Both should be a ton of fun. I spent a lot of time this week making the materials for the blogging workshop, including cheatsheets, worsheets, and a presentation. So stay tuned for those!
* I'm working on a couple really cool projects right now that will launch in the next few weeks. I have put a lot of time into those, so no full post this week! That being said, [here's](https://twitter.com/ASpittel/status/1039155061891493888) a link to all the newsletters I read -- I kept track this week! And [here's](https://twitter.com/ASpittel/status/1040059050937995264) some thoughts on learning algorithms.

# Creative Stuff

* [The Dogs of CodePen](https://blog.codepen.io/2018/09/05/the-dogs-of-codepen/) - Adorable dogs drawn with code!
* [The colors of different decades](https://colorleap.app/dates) - these color palettes by time period are really cool. Could definitely see myself building things with them!

# Coding Resources

* [From Chef to Programmer: Lessons From The Kitchen](https://dev.to/jmschuurmans/from-chef-to-programmer-lessons-from-the-kitchen-4441) - I really enjoyed this post about career change and the lessons learned from it.
* [Additive Animation with the Web Animations API](https://css-tricks.com/additive-animation-web-animations-api) - The webanimation API is going to be awesome!

# Blogging

* [How to write Medium stories people will actually read](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8) - I really like this post about blogging -- I will definitely use a lot of these in the future!

# Life

* I'm back to being a member of a CrossFit gym, and I forgot how much I love it. Its so much fun, and a great workout.
* Sunny weather - I can't wait for it to be nice out again in DC. Its been tough to get through this rainy, gross week here!
* Google Inbox - I am so sad that Inbox is being phased out. I've used it exclusively since it came out, and I loved its bundling feature. I am really going to miss it!

Happy Friday!
Ali
