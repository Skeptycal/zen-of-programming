Hi friends!

I can't believe it's September already! Feels like the summer flew by. Anyway, here are my links for the week:

# My Stuff

* I wrote a post about how I write blog posts [My Blog Post Workflow: from Topic to Publication](https://zen-of-programming.com/blog-post-workflow) this week. Blogging has been so transformative for me, and I really hope that this helps people who also want to start writing!
* I'm not quite ready to announce it yet, but I'm going to have a personal project launching next week that I am so excited about. I used [Airtable](https://airtable.com/invite/r/64JgTtSO) as a database for a Gatsby app, and I may never build a backend again. Just kidding -- but really Gatsby is so cool and you should try it out! *note: if you sign up for a free Airtable account with that link, I get upgraded to a premium account at completely no cost to you*
* I'm talking at a couple things coming up if you're in the DC area! I'm doing a [Blogging Workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-DC/events/253906246/) for Women Who Code next weekend, and then I'm doing a talk on [Generative Art](https://nvite.com/CodePenDC/q7qxn8) with my friend James a few weeks later! Both should be a ton of fun.

# Creative Stuff

* [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) - You can create super cool sprites for games with this tool!
* [CSS background-blend-mode Examples](https://bennettfeely.com/gradients/) - These are so cool -- awesome visuals with very little code needed!

# Coding Resources

* [How to create pure CSS illustrations and animate them](https://dev.to/agathacco/how-to-create-pure-css-illustrations-and-animate-them---part-1-1j1k) - I really like this series on CSS art -- very well explained and great looking images.
* [CSS Doodle](https://css-doodle.com/) - I really want to use this web component for drawing with css... it looks amazing.
* [My Struggle to Learn React](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/my-struggle-to-learn-react/) - I think this article is really interesting -- I can definitely see the conflation between ES6 and React if you learn both at a similar time. And -- I'm also obsessed with the bubble interaction on his site. I'm definitely going to draw inspiration from it in the future.

# Blogging

* [SEO Analyzer](https://neilpatel.com/seo-analyzer/) - I'm starting to try and figure out SEO, and this tool is really helpful -- kind of like lighthouse testing for SEO.

# Life

* [Here to Make Friends](https://www.acast.com/heretomakefriends) - The only reason I'm still watching the Bachelor in Paradise is because of this podcast. It is so funny and offers great takes on the Bachelor franchise. But honestly, five hours of tv in one week? That's too much.
* I finished up Crazy Rich Asians this week, I really liked it and may try to watch the movie at some point, even though I'm not at all a movie person.
* I think I'm going to [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ASpittel) about all the newsletters I subscribe to over the course of next week, I learn so much from all of them, and they are my primary source of new information.,

Happy Friday!
Ali
