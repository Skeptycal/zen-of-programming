Hi friends!

I'm so excited to be back in DC and also be back to teaching! I have a lot of really exciting things in the pipeline right now, it was overall a great week.

## Shout Outs

* [P5](https://p5js.org/) - Using P5 makes using HTML Canvas so much easier! I did a project this week in just Canvas and it made me so thankful for P5! 
* [Caliphate Podcast](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/podcasts/caliphate-isis-rukmini-callimachi.html) - I listened to this whole series this week and I found it fascinating.
* The DC weather - the last few days have been perfect -- mid 70s and sunny!
* [def programming](http://www.defprogramming.com/) - one of my students shared this awesome site with programming quotes on it. A lot are awesome!
* [Zondicons](http://www.zondicons.com/icons.html) - these icons are really pretty.
* [Girl's Night In](http://girlsnightinclub.com/?ref=RzkxcENBamo=&mc_cid=a85991a83b&mc_eid=c59db81e28) - I really enjoy this newsletter and the links in it. Its super well designed, and I read through the whole thing each week. I'm not even a woman who'd rather stay in, but I still find it really helpful!

## My Writing

* [A Web Design Crash Course: From one non-designer to another](https://zen-of-programming.com/design) - I wrote down a bunch of my design tips this week! Lots of visual examples, CSS snippets, and even a checklist.

## Social Media

* I've been working on my [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/) a little bit this week!
* I made a [Mastadon](https://mastodon.social/@aspittel), I'm not sure how much I'll use it right now, but it seems like a cool platform!
* My favorite coding puzzle was [Tuesday's](https://twitter.com/ASpittel/status/1031889283609710593) find the smallest number that can be made out of a list of digits. Lots of fun answers there!

See ya next week!
