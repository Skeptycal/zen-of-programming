Hi friends!

You may have noticed that this is coming from a new email address ðŸ˜€! I set up the email address ali@zen-of-programming.com this week, which I'm super excited about! I've also reformatted the newsletter a little bit, so its more organized and you get even more links!

# My Stuff

* I wrote an [introduction to React](https://zen-of-programming.com/beginners-guide-react) this week. I think a lot of resources go a little bit too fast, so I wanted to write something a little bit more beginner friendly. 
* I made a bunch of graphics to make my [25 Tips for New Developers](https://zen-of-programming.com/start-programming) more share-able!
* I added new [contact](https://zen-of-programming.com/contact) and [about](https://zen-of-programming.com/about) pages to my blog.

# Creative Stuff

* [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/) - I've been really noticing when sites don't have favicons recently. Favicons are the icons that you see on the tab when you're looking at a website, and they can make a website look a lot more legitimate! This site makes creating a great one quick and easy!
* [Blotter.js](https://blotter.js.org/) - This JavaScript library for creating interesting text effects is so cool! Just remember to still make your site accessible!
* [AI JS](https://aijs.rocks/) - This is a really cool site filled with AI-powered JavaScript apps. There's one that picks an emoji to match the facial expression in a picture, an image alt text generator, a sketch generator, and a bunch of other cool apps.

# Coding Resources

* [Front-End Performance Checklist](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Performance-Checklist/blob/master/README.md) - this checklist of performance tips is awesome. I haven't heard a lot of these before, but I'm definitely going to try and implement as many as possible.
* [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) - this is one of my favorite all-time coding books. I first read it a year and a half ago when I was interviewing for jobs. It has a ton of great computer science and algorithms stuff, and its explained really well. Highly recommend!
* [CSS Grid Cheatsheet](http://grid.malven.co/) - I love cheatsheets -- this is super helpful for people who already know CSS grid but want to remember the syntax or attributes!

# Blogging

* [Markdown To Medium](http://markdowntomedium.com/) - a couple awesome people on Twitter suggested this to make crossposting easier. It even posts code snippets to GitHub Gists and embeds them.
* Social Media cards - you know when you share a link to social media and a picture pops up under your post? Those are called social media cards, and you have to program them into your sites using meta tags. I've been working pretty hard to get these looking good across sources, and they end up looking really cool!

# Life

* [Crazy Rich Asians](https://www.amazon.com/Crazy-Rich-Asians-Trilogy/dp/0345803787) - I'm currently reading this book (so please no spoilers!!!), but I'm totally hooked. Its fascinating to imagine the world of Singapore's elite.
* [The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/podcasts/the-daily) - two weeks of New York Times Podcasts in a row! I've been listening to this one on the way home from work every day. I like learning more in depth about news events, its a nice break from my normal Tweet-length glances at news stories.
* [To All the Boys I Loved Before](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80203147?trackId=13752289&tctx=0%2C0%2Cc555b695b1f1619bcda10da1e255dd73d93c2ccc%3A8da3c2b3fb78174b130b281225a745e899fb835b%2C%2C) - I tend to have a show on while I create graphics for posts or write quicker pieces like this newsletter. I had this on earlier this week, and I thought it was really cute! If you're looking for a fun, easy chickflick, try this movie out!
* Waking up early - I've been getting to work around 6:45 AM every day, and it has been so nice to get a couple hours of work in before the day even starts.

Happy Friday!
Ali
