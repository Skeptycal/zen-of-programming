I want to get back into writing more technical content, and React is one of my favorite technologies, so I thought I would create a React intro! This post requires knowledge of at least basic CSS, HTML, and JavaScript -- I am of the strong opinion that people should know these before moving on to libraries built on them!

## What is React

React is a JavaScript library build in 2013 by the Facebook development teach in order to make user interfaces more modular (or reusable) and easier to maintain. According to React's website it is used to "Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs."

I'm going to use a lot of Facebook examples throughout this post since they wrote React in the first place!

Remember when Facebook moved from just likes to reactions? Instead of just being able to like posts,  you can now react with a heart, or a smiley face, or a like to any post. If those reactions were primarily made in HTML, it would be a huge amount of work to change all of those likes to reactions and to make sure that they work.

This is where React comes in -- instead of implementing the "separation of concerns" that gets impressed upon developers from day one, we have a different architecture in React that increases modularity based on a component structure instead of separating the different programming languages.

### React vs. Vanilla JavaScript 

When we talk about "vanilla" JavaScript, we are normally talking about writing JavaScript code that doesn't use additional libraries like JQuery, React, Angular, or Vue. If you would like to read more about those and what a framework is, I have a [post](https://zen-of-programming.com/web-framework-intro) all about web frameworks!
