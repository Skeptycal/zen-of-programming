Week one of the Zen of Programming in the books! I am super excited to be working on this project and to get to write about things that are a little bit more personal to me. I will probably eventually no longer be able to write every day, but for now, that posting schedule is working so I will stick with it! On Fridays, I am going to write a wrap-up with some of my favorite links from the week and any updates!

### Things to Read

* [How exactly does binary code work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgbV6DLVezo) - An amazing explanation of what binary is and how computers use it. I am excited to watch the whole series!
* [Amazingly Paired Google Fonts](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/) - I get so much inspiration from the font pairings on this site -- so creative, and they all look great even if I don't love the font.
* [AI, Ain't I A Woman?](https://www.notflawless.ai/) - This video is incredibly well done -- A spoken word piece borrowing from Sojourner Truth's incredibly important 1851 speech at the Women's Convention in Akron, speaking about the racial bias in facial recognition algorithms, specifically pertaining to gender.
* [So pretty!](https://codepen.io/meowwwls/full/XEKzmP/) - I love this poster recreation using CSS Grid -- so pretty!
* [Javascript Framework Comparison with Examples (React, Vue & Hyperapp)](https://hackernoon.com/javascript-framework-comparison-with-examples-react-vue-hyperapp-97f064fb468d) - I _love_ all three of these frameworks, and this is a really awesome in-depth comparison of them.
* [The Shell Introduction I Wish I Had](https://dev.to/maxwell_dev/the-shell-introduction-i-wish-i-had-551k) - an incredibly in-depth and beginner-friendly introduction to the shell -- a must read for CLI newbies!

### My Posts

* [Hello, World](https://zen-of-programming.com/hello-world/) -- My reasoning for starting this project and what it's going to contain!
* [My Visual Studio Code Setup](https://zen-of-programming.com/vs-code-setup/) - How I set up my text editor.
* [My Goals for 24](https://zen-of-programming.com/goals-4-24/) - I entered my mid-twenties this week, so I took a minute to reflect and goal set for the upcoming year.
* [What is a Web Framework, and Why Should I Use One?](https://zen-of-programming.com/web-framework-intro) - Based on my first ever conference talk from last year, I discuss the different types of web frameworks and why we use them!

### Code Challenges

Each day on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ASpittel), I post a code challenge to get my brain fired up in the morning. Here are the ones from this week:
