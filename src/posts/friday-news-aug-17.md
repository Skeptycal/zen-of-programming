I am so excited to be back in DC -- it feels like when I first moved here four years ago. There's a lot of new places in my neighborhood even after just a few months away! I have been trying to take a true vacation, so I haven't written too much this week, but I will be back to work next week and, with that, back to a more normal schedule!

## Shout Outs

* [Desktop backgrounds](http://www.designlovefest.com/category/downloads/) - I got a [monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099XBO5E?ie=UTF8) for my computer, which was probably overdue, and having a pretty background on it is really important since it's a huge part of my room. Since college, I've been using the Design Love Fest's artistic backgrounds -- I think they're gorgeous!
* [From the Corner of the Oval: A Memoir](https://www.amazon.com/Corner-Oval-Memoir-Beck-Dorey-Stein/dp/0525509127) - I binge listened to this on the drive to DC and I loved it. It almost made me want to work in politics again!
* [Habit journal](https://github.com/aspittel/intention-journal) - I built a super quick habit journal script, and I've been using that daily. Its really helpful for prioritizing tasks!
* [AMA](https://github.com/aspittel/ama) - I'm trying to centralize the questions I get because the number of emails, LinkedIn messages, and DMs I'm getting is getting a bit unmanageable. There are already some answered questions on there, my plan is to batch respond to them on Sundays!
* Blue Bottle Coffee's New Orleans Iced Coffee - this stuff is magical, it's part chicory, part coffee, part milk, and part sweetener. I can't stop talking about it.
* [Matter.js](http://brm.io/matter-js/) - Matter.js is a physics engine built with JavaScript -- you can build some really cool animations with it -- definitely something I want to try down the road!

## My Writing

I only published one full post this week, though I wrote drafts for a few more that will be releasing over the next few weeks!

## Social Media

* We hit #CodingPuzzle 30 this week! I've started to see a lot more people participate too, which is so cool! My favorite one from this week:
