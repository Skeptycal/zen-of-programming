This week was insane! It was my last full week in Hartford, Connecticut after teaching a web development course for the past three months. Being away from DC has been really hard; I missed my friends and normal life a lot. But, without the distractions, I really focused on building my blog over the last few weeks which has turned out to be going pretty well so far!

Speaking of, I hit the top of Hacker News yesterday for [my post](https://zen-of-programming.com/kickass-portfolio) about [my portfolio](https://www.alispit.tel/). If you're wondering what that looks like in terms of page views, here's an hour by hour look:

I don't think my traffic was bad before either! I had 1,561 hits in the two weeks since launch!

I've been giving people tips on their sites mostly via Twitter -- I've done about 25 so far and still have quite a few to look through! If you want me to take a look at yours, [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ASpittel) me!

The blog site itself has also gotten some improvements this week, it is a full progressive web application now (which is way overkill but still really cool), and its [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) testing is looking pretty decent! I've also added in some image optimization and an [RSS feed](https://zen-of-programming.com/rss.xml). If you are interested in the code or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), it is on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspittel/zen-of-programming)!

I'm on vacation the next two weeks which I'm really excited about, but I'll still be posting as usual on my blog and sending this newsletter out!

## Shout Outs

* [Understanding Python Bytecode](https://youtu.be/weBXlLF6an8) - I really love this talk by James Bennett about what goes on with Python behind the scenes. I learned a lot from it, and even if you're not a Python developer, I think you will too!
* [Generative Artistry](https://generativeartistry.com/) - This site has some really awesome tutorials for getting started with generative art. The intersection of art and code is so unbelievably cool to me, but the math can be intimidating. This site really breaks it down.
* [Designspiration](https://www.designspiration.net/) - I rarely get design inspiration from other websites, I usually get inspired by things totally offline like restaurant fronts, tattoos, or even just from a cool color palette. I love viewing the posters on Designspiration, and would love to recreate more of them using code.
* [Why I teach math through knitting](https://theconversation.com/why-i-teach-math-through-knitting-95896?utm_source=CreativeMornings+Global&utm_campaign=911c8b5bf1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_07_17_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1768cc808f-911c8b5bf1-324346617&mc_cid=911c8b5bf1&mc_eid=ced5f79cc4) - this is a great reflection on teaching, the stigma around math, and creative solutions to problems. I try really hard to think outside the box while teaching, and to build an accessible curriculum -- this article was really inspiring.
* [Vladimir Guerrero Ready for Fearless 19-Year-Old Son to Steal Family Spotlight](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2786518-vladimir-guerrero-ready-for-fearless-19-year-old-son-to-steal-family-spotlight) - I've been going to lots of minor league baseball games this summer, especially the New Hampshire Fisher Cats' games, where Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been playing. It's incredible to watch him, and I'm really excited to see where he goes.
* [BEAUTY BRAWL - How inclusive are beauty brands around the world?](https://pudding.cool/2018/06/makeup-shades/?ref=creativemornings.com&utm_source=CreativeMornings+Global&utm_campaign=99491df1e3-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_07_17_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1768cc808f-99491df1e3-324346617&mc_cid=99491df1e3&mc_eid=ced5f79cc4) - Doing makeup has been a hobby of mine for a long time, and I really appreciate this data-centric deep dive into the inclusivity of beauty brands. Its a really important topic, and I'm glad its getting more attention.
* [Data is Plural](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) - if you are looking for interesting data sets, Jeremy Singer-Vine's newsletter is awesome. From rejected license plates to animal tracking, there are so many cool things to do analyses on!
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - I moved my blog over to Netlify, and I'm obsessed. It makes my life so easy, and its totally free. Highly, highly recommend.

## My Posts

* [Building a Kickass Portfolio](https://zen-of-programming.com/kickass-portfolio) - I did a retrospective on my portfolio sites throughout the years and wrote about what worked and what didn't. My offer still stands to review anybody's portfolio that they send me!
* [My Terminal Setup: iTerm + Zsh](https://zen-of-programming.com/terminal-setup) - My terminal setup has followed me from computer to computer, and I really love it. 

## Social Media

* The first [#ArtTechChat](https://twitter.com/ArtTechChat) was awesome, there were a lot of really cool insights from everyone involved. Tune in this Sunday for the second iteration -- we'll either be talking about user interface design or building a portfolio!

* I think my favorite #CodingPuzzle from the week was converting RGB colors to Hexadecimals.

* I think my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ali_writes_code/) is here to stay -- I posted some of my CSS art and design work on there this week. I'm still playing around with it a lot to see what works, but I'm having fun with it!
