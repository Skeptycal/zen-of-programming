The next step is publishing your content. This step is pretty reliant on your goals for your blog. It is 100% perfectly valid to write your blog posts primarily for yourself in order to document your processes and growth. It's also totally valid to want to just write for a certain community and for your content to be targeted at them. Its also valid to want a high readership for your blog posts. 

I want to gain viewership for two reasons. First, I hope that I can help people and spread a positive energy with my blog posts, and in order to do that people need to be reading my posts. On a more selfish note, I *love* blogging and teaching, so I want to see where what I'm doing can go.

So, I also want to share my advice for growing a reader base. Keep in mind, I'm not an expert at this by any means -- I've been blogging less than a year and The Zen of Programming concept is less than 2 months old. That being sai
